A support class to simplify calculating interesting properties of timespans (such as seconds, hours, minutes, days, and years)

## Installation

## Usage

```ruby
now = Time.new(2017, 12, 29, 13, 24, 22)
new_years = Time.new(2018, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)
ts = SimpleTimespan.new(new_years - now)
ts.to_s # 2 days 10 hours 35 minutes 38 seconds
```
